# telemedicine_project
In October 2020, a research consortium by four HIV and infectious diseases units of general acute public hospitals of Buenos Aires city began an implementation study aimed to analyze obstacles and facilitators of telemedicine in the care of people living with HIV(PLHIV). TM visits were conducted through phone or videocalls. We explore willingness of patients on continuing or not using this strategy. In this repository, are shown some results of a classification model developed to determine the features of those patients likely to continue with this strategy.
We developed a Logistic Regression model using LASSO as a regularization strategy to determine the features that have more impact in choosing or not telemedicine for HIV care. Some of these are: Being a Trans or cisgender women; 2) Having completed, at least, high school education; 3) Live in a hotel or a shared room. In the middle, we carried out a threshold tunning to improve the model performances.
